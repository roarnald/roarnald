# Hello, my name is Ronald!
I am a _Frontend Web Enthuthiast_, and a _Node JS Junkie_ from Singapore.

As a huge Typescript fanatic, I have a passion for writing clean, scalable and reusable code. I first started learning programming in Assembly and C, which explains my drive to bring low-level optimization concepts into Javascript. I have experience in team building and work flow revamping to incorporate a learning culture and ensuring that individual developer can learn with the team.
